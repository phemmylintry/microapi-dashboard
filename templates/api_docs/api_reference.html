            You can use the Comment MicroApi in test mode,
            which does not affect your live data. The API key you use to authenticate
            the request determines whether the request is in live mode or test mode. The
            Comment
            MicroApi differs
            for every account as we release new versions and tailor functionality. Log in to
            see
            docs
            customized to your version of the API, with your test key and data.
