            <p>
              The Comment API gives the developer access to built-in functionalities for when they want to
              implement comments and replies within their own application. Basic functionalities are available
              for creation, update, and deletion of comments and replies while ensuring that only users
              authorized are allowed to use such functionalities. Additionally, there are extra features such
              as filtering, sorting, voting, and flagging available.
              <br><br>
              You can use the Comment MicroApi in test mode,
              which does not affect your live data. The API key you use to authenticate
              the request determines whether the request is in live mode or test mode. The Comment MicroApi differs
              for every account as we release new versions and tailor functionality. Log in to see docs
              customized to your version of the API, with your test key and data.<br><br>
